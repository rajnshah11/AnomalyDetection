# Activity Recognition Model

## Overview

This project involves constructing a deep learning model that recognizes activities as either ordinary or anomalous actions using Python, a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN), and OpenCV. The model is trained to distinguish between normal and abnormal activities, achieving a prediction accuracy of 93%. This can be particularly useful in applications such as surveillance, where identifying unusual behavior is critical.

## Features

- **Activity Recognition**: Classifies actions into ordinary or anomalous categories.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 93%.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for video capture and real-time activity recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for building and training the model.
- **3D CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning algorithm that processes spatial and temporal data to recognize activities.
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision library used for video processing and real-time recognition.

## Installation & Setup
